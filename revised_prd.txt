# Stellar Swipe: Social Crowdfunding on Stellar

## Overview
Stellar Swipe is a social crowdfunding platform built on the Stellar blockchain that enables frictionless support for on-chain projects. It allows users to discover and fund projects with a simple swipe gesture, without requiring traditional crypto wallet setup or blockchain knowledge. By combining Web2-level simplicity with Web3 security and transparency, Stellar Swipe makes supporting innovative projects as easy as using a dating app, while maintaining the benefits of blockchain-based crowdfunding.

## Core Features

### 1. Swipe-to-Fund UX
- **What it does**: Presents users with a card-based interface showing projects seeking funding, allowing them to swipe right to commit a small amount of XLM (e.g., 5 XLM) to back projects.
- **Why it's important**: Removes friction from the funding process, making it accessible to users with no crypto experience.
- **How it works**: Projects are presented as swipeable cards with compelling visuals and brief descriptions. A right swipe initiates the funding process, while a left swipe skips to the next project.

### 2. Social Authentication & Identity
- **What it does**: Allows users to log in with their social accounts (X, Farcaster) or email via Privy.
- **Why it's important**: Eliminates the need for seed phrases or crypto wallets while maintaining security.
- **How it works**: Privy handles social authentication and wallet creation, providing a seamless Web2-style login experience.

### 3. Stellar Wallet Infrastructure
- **What it does**: Uses Privy's built-in Stellar wallet integration to create and manage Stellar wallets.
- **Why it's important**: Provides blockchain functionality without exposing users to technical complexity.
- **How it works**: The app leverages Privy's server-side wallet creation API to generate a Stellar wallet for each user upon account creation.

### 4. Soroban Smart Contract Integration
- **What it does**: Uses a funding contract for project management and fund distribution.
- **Why it's important**: Enables secure, trustless fund management.
- **How it works**: The funding contract manages the release of funds based on predefined conditions.

### 5. Native On-ramping via Privy
- **What it does**: Leverages Privy's built-in on-ramping solutions to allow users to purchase XLM.
- **Why it's important**: Removes the barrier of acquiring cryptocurrency before participating.
- **How it works**: Users can purchase XLM directly in the app, with funds delivered to their Stellar wallet for immediate use.

### 6. Reputation System
- **What it does**: Builds on-chain reputation for users based on their backing, sharing, and referring activities.
- **Why it's important**: Creates a social layer that incentivizes participation and quality project discovery.
- **How it works**: Users earn reputation points for successful project backing, referring new users, and other positive contributions to the ecosystem.

### 7. Project Discovery & Management
- **What it does**: Provides comprehensive tools for discovering projects and tracking their funding progress.
- **Why it's important**: Helps users find projects aligned with their interests and monitor their investments.
- **How it works**: 
  - Advanced filtering system with multiple parameters (category, funding amount, time remaining, etc.)
  - Personalized recommendations based on user history and preferences
  - Project cards with clear visual progress indicators
  - Detailed project views with milestones and updates
  - Bookmark/save functionality for projects of interest
  - Notifications for project updates and funding milestones
  - Search with natural language processing for intuitive project finding

### 8. Social Sharing & Referrals
- **What it does**: Enables users to share projects and earn reputation when others join through their referral links.
- **Why it's important**: Drives organic growth and rewards community building.
- **How it works**: 
  - One-click sharing to popular social platforms (X, Farcaster, etc.)
  - Customizable share messages and project previews
  - Unique referral codes generated for each shared project
  - Real-time tracking of referral conversions and rewards
  - Referral leaderboards to encourage competition
  - Tiered referral bonuses based on user reputation
  - Interactive share cards designed for maximum engagement
  - Analytics dashboard for tracking share performance

### 9. User Experience & Engagement
- **What it does**: Creates a gamified, habit-forming experience that keeps users returning.
- **Why it's important**: Increases user retention and platform growth.
- **How it works**:
  - Daily swipe quota with streak rewards
  - Achievement badges for platform milestones
  - Personalized feed algorithm optimized for discovery
  - Onboarding flow with interactive tutorials
  - Progressive disclosure of features to avoid overwhelm
  - Frictionless transitions between browsing and backing
  - Animation and haptic feedback for key actions

2. **Risk**: Smart contract security vulnerabilities
   **Mitigation**: Conduct thorough security audits; implement formal verification; start with simpler contract logic and iterate; use established contract patterns.

3. **Risk**: Performance issues with blockchain transactions
   **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic UI updates; use caching strategies; consider layer-2 solutions if needed; optimize batch processing for transactions.

### MVP Scope Management

1. **Risk**: Feature creep extending development timeline
   **Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize features based on user value; implement clear acceptance criteria for MVP; create separate backlogs for post-MVP features.

2. **Risk**: Overengineering initial implementation
   **Mitigation**: Focus on proving core value proposition first; defer complex features; use rapid prototyping to validate assumptions; get early user feedback.
